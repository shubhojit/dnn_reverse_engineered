The two directories here are:

1) classify_text_cnn : This directory contains a bunch of reverse engineered deep learning models for sentence classification and eventually towards document classification. It's a work in progress.
2) fisherfaces_dir : This directory's an implementation of the fisherfaces algorithm in order to better understand the Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm.
